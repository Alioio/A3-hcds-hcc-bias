# Analysis of bias in Wikimedia politician data

 Name: Ali Bekta≈ü <br>
 Date: 30 Nov 2020
 
 ### Goal
 ______________________________________
 
 The notebook in this repository contains the code to analyze existing bias in wikipedia articles about politicians. 
 
 ### Data sources: 
 
 - Wikipedia article data: https://figshare.com/articles/Untitled_Item/5513449
 - Population data: <a href="https://github.com/FUB-HCC/hcds-winter-2020/tree/main/assignments/A3_Bias/_data">_data folder of the assignments GitHub Repo</a>. Is originally drawn and edited from: https://www.prb.org/international/indicator/population/table/
 - Wikimedia ORES API: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES
 
 ### Resources used
 _____________________________________________
 
The environment dependencies can be installed via pip install -r requirements.txt. I recommend installing in a Conda environment running Python version 3.7.

Documentation for Python can be found here: https://docs.python.org/3.7/
Documentation for Jupyter Notebook can be found here: https://jupyter.org/documentation

The following Python packages were used and their documentation can be found here: 

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html">os</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://numpy.org/doc/">numpy</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/">altair</a></li>
 </ul>

### The Objective Revision Evaluation Service <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES">(ORES)</a>

This API will be used to estimate the quality of the given Wikipedia article in the specific revision and to 
categorize it to one of the following categories: 
<ol>
<li> FA - Featured article
<li> GA - Good article
<li> B - B-class article
<li> C - C-class article
<li> Start - Start-class article
<li> Stub - Stub-class article
 </ol>
 
 > Some of article revision ORES API is not able to classify and returns an error. This is mainly due to that the API cannot find the the revision.For these articles 
 the quality column contains the enrty *Revision not found*
 
 ### Files created
 ------------------------------------
 
 This notbook creates two CSV file after processing as part of this analysis. 
 This files are located in the *\data_clean* folder in this repository. 
 
 Articles from some countries could not be anlysed because data from two different sources had to be merged in order to make 
 the analysis. The wikipedia and ORES data and the population data. There were countries wich were present in only one 
 of the two datasources. Therefore these countries had to be removed and were excluded from the analysis. These articles are listed 
 in the file *countries-no_match.csv*. Articles which were considered in the analysis are listed in the file *politicians_by_country.csv*.
 
 <ul>
 <li>\data_clean\politicians_by_country.csv <t> This file contains information about all articles where the 
 <li> \data_clean\countries-no_match.csv <t> This file lists all articles which were excluded for the analysis.
 </ul>

 Results
 ------------------------------------------
 
 Started with showing the top 10 countries articles per population. Here the distortion caused by the missalignment of the units 
 in which the population is represented in the population dataset is very significant.
 
![countries_top_10.png](https://github.com/Alioio/A3-hcds-hcc-bias/blob/main/data_clean/visualizations/countries_top_10.png)

Then continued with the bottom ten countries:

![countries_bot_10.png](https://github.com/Alioio/A3-hcds-hcc-bias/blob/main/data_clean/visualizations/countries_bot_10.png)

In the next step the propotion of total articles and articles related with good quality is compared across countries. 
For the top 10 countries a suprising result was that North Korea appears at the first rank in this list. This is due to low 
number of atricles North Korea has in total about their politicians (*39 in total*) and suprisingly *8* of these articles show 
a high quality.  
The 10 lowest quality ranking contains countries which has a high number of articles but less articles in good quality like. 
Except of Belgium and Switzerland and Portugal where Belgium is appearing with a ratio: *523 articles in total but only 1 high quality rated article* and Switzerland with: *401 articles in total and also only 1 high quality rated article* the the other countries in this list did not suprised me. These are countries where I assume they are not so well known by the majority of the wikipedia article authors and another reason
could be that these countries are neither English speaking or known to have a great public education system.

By comparing regions it is again notable that the error cuased by differnt units in which the population is represented is causing a 
**significant distortion** which makes the results of the following chart for example **unreliable**. Europe for example includes smaller countries 
like *Malta* or Latin Amerika with *Bahamas* where their population is represented by thousends while for bigger countires like the *USA* the population is represented in millions.
